# song-book-vue
Example Feathers + Vue app. The frontend. A collection of performance repertoire for singers and muscians.

To get started, simply run `node server.js` inside the project directory. 

Note that if something fails, or you change any of the code, you should run an `npm run build` command for webpack to re-build the project. 

Default API connection is localhost:3030 - Which is where feathers runs by default. If you need to change this, simply change the `Vue.http.options.root` variable within `main.js` inside the src folder of this project.
